# Assets üçå
Nature's open source,  
Human's code follows its course;  
Common force, no remorse.

Bananas in stash,  
Code in a digital cache;  
Ideas, they flash.  

---

Banana is stashed,  
Just like a bug fix is patched,  
In code, secrets flashed.  

---

Ape's yellow hoard,  
In GitHub, code is stored,  
Silent accord.  

---

Banana in sight,  
Like code in the night,  
Quiet as a kite.
